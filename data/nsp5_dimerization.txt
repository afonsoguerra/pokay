# This mutation demonstrates that glutathionylation (in vivo oxidative post-translational modification of cysteine) of Mpro/NSP5 residue C300
# is responsible for controlling the dimerization of the protein, where the monomer's protease activity is hampereed by the collapsing 
# of the active site pocket.
