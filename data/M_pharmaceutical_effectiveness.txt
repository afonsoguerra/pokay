# This mutation is candidate for resistance to the first FDA-authorized Mpro inhibitor, PF-07321332. 
# It has WT-like function in both the FRET and growth screens, would lead to a predicted decrease in 
# inhibitor binding energy upon mutation of greater than 1 kcal/mol, and is a single nucleotide base change.

# Mutations at position 142 should be readily available
# to Mpro evolution and appear likely to influence loop conformation at a site where PF-07321332
# extends beyond the substrate envelope. Together these observations suggest that N142
# warrants further attention as a potential contributor to drug resistance.
